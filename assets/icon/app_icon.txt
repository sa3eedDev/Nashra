# App Icon Placeholder
# 
# For a real app, you would need to generate proper app icons for different platforms
# You can use tools like:
# - flutter_launcher_icons package
# - https://appicon.co/
# - https://www.figma.com/ (for designing icons)
#
# This is just a placeholder file to indicate where app icons should be placed.
